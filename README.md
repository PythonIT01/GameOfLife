## Code optimization

I am in the process of learning / training code optimization. I know that this is a process that can be very individual for certain problems but there are some general ideas to try. If you have any tips (please not full code, just hints), comment them somewhere or mail me. I got some ideas myself that yet need to be implemented.

## Usage

Feel free to use this project, though I cannot see why someone would...
